\title{Process cwb context sentences}
\usage{
cwb_context(
  x,
  cols = conc,
  delim = "</s>",
  col_names = c("context3", "context2", "context1", "context", "end"),
  no_of_contexts = 3,
  filter_incomplete = FALSE,
  debug = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A dataframe with two columns: cpos and context with the sentences to be detokenized}

\item{cols}{The name of the column with the concordance (usually "conc")}

\item{delim}{The delimiter at which the sentences shall be split.}

\item{col_names}{A vector with the column names (default works for 3 context sentences)}

\item{no_of_contexts}{An integer with the number of LEFT context sentences}

\item{filter_incomplete}{Should sentences with "@ @ @" be excluded?}

\item{debug}{separate_wider_delim() tends to break with messy data, so a debugging round to identify the issue might be needed (in which case filter_incomplete should be set to FALSE)}
}
\value{
A data frame with detokenized text.
